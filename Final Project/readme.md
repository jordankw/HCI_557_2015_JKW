On Windows, build SDK first, using SDK/glew-1.13.0/lib/Release/Win32/glew32.lib as the GLEW library. This should already be configured properly in the cmakelists file in the Final Project folder. Copy SDK/glew-1.13.0/bin/[debug or release]/Win32/glew32.dll into the output folder for the project executable. 

Controls: change view by toggling with the 'V' key between a  chase camera and an overhead view aligned with the track.
