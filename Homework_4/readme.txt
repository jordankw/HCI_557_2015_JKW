Homework 4


I used the same project for both parts of the assignment. In hw4_main.cpp I load either hw_shader.fs or hw_shader_part2.fs. hw_shader.fs displays one texture on the plane, and hw_shader.fs displays two. I tried 2 methods of blending for part 2. One adds the color values from each image, and the other divides texture 1 values by texture 2 values, then divides again by the texture 3 value. I used the same texture coordinates for each texture as well.
